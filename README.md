Tom and Jerry Image Classification
This project is a simple image classification model that identifies whether a given image is of Tom or Jerry using deep learning. The dataset consists of labeled images of Tom and Jerry characters. Two approaches were implemented:

✅ A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

✅ Transfer Learning using the pre-trained VGG16 model

The models were built and trained in Google Colab using TensorFlow/Keras.
This project was completed as part of the Machine Learning Lab (CSE432) course.
